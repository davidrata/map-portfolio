# Map Portfolio – GIS-Based Suitability Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository showcases the **final output of a GIS-based multi-criteria suitability analysis** conducted to identify potential sites for a new university in the **West Midlands, UK**.

The map represents the **end product of a structured spatial evaluation process**, where multiple environmental and planning constraints were systematically assessed and integrated. Key factors included **flood risk, land use constraints, terrain characteristics (slope and elevation), and spatial accessibility**, all selected to reflect sustainability and long-term resilience considerations.

Through a series of **spatial analyses** — including buffering, rasterisation, reclassification, and weighted overlays — land parcels were progressively filtered and scored based on their relative suitability. The final classification groups land into five categories, from *Very Not Suitable* to *Most Suitable*, providing a **transparent, reproducible decision-support tool** for sustainable infrastructure planning.

## Key Notes
- Coordinate Reference System: **EPSG:27700 (British National Grid)**
- Suitability classes reflect **relative planning suitability**, not absolute development recommendations
- Map produced as the **final synthesis stage** after multiple environmental and spatial evaluations
